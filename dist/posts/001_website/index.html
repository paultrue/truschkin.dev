      <h1>The journey starts</h1>

<p>Here I am, talking about my first project in the <strong>truschkin.dev</strong> era, which is this website itself. To make this website work, I have already done a couple things I have never done before. Let's investigate them step by step:</p>
<h4 id="0.-buying-a-domain">0. Buying a domain <a class="direct-link" href="#0.-buying-a-domain">#</a></h4>
<p>A friend of mine suggested me to look out for domains on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap.com</a>. I went for it at bought the domain you are currently visiting. Finally I could call myself a domain owner üéâ.</p>
<h4 id="1.-creating-a-repo">1. Creating a repo <a class="direct-link" href="#1.-creating-a-repo">#</a></h4>
<p>Since I was already familiar how to use git and github, this step went seamlessly. I created a <a href="https://github.com/paultrue/truschkin.dev">repo on github</a>, checked it out on my machine. I added a basic <code>index.html</code> + <code>.gitignore</code> to set a base for this project.</p>
<h4 id="2.-hosting-website">2. Hosting website <a class="direct-link" href="#2.-hosting-website">#</a></h4>
<p>There are many solutions to host a website. I went with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>, since almost every coworker mentioned at least once how much they love it. It was my first time to host a website completely by myself, which made me really curious to see how it works out using netlify.</p>
<p>It turns out that netlify is pretty easy to use. All I had to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>add domain</li>
<li>add site and connect it to my github-project</li>
<li>point my domain's nameservers to netlify in their DNS-settings</li>
</ol>
<p>So I went back to <a href="http://namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a> and pasted every netlify nameserver in the <code>Custom DNS</code> section in the settings of my domain. DONE! Some magic made my domain, netlify and github talk to each other.<br>
Now, like most of my coworkers, I am in love with netlify as well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
<h4 id="3.-choosing-a-framework-for-this-project">3. Choosing a framework for this project <a class="direct-link" href="#3.-choosing-a-framework-for-this-project">#</a></h4>
<p>Finding a base for the website was a though decision. Because I perfectly know that I usually fall into a rabbithole exploring many possible solutions. It had to be simple to setup and easy to use. Something lightweight and well supported by the community. No backend, no database. A static site generator was the obvious choice for me.<br>
Some years ago I played around with <a href="https://hexo.io/">hexo</a> and really enjoyed it. So I did some research on how the topic of static site generator has evolved. After reading through a couple resources <a href="https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator">this comparison</a> finally made me pick <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>. It has great documentation, helpful tutorials for beginners and offers a bunch of ready to use starter projects. I went for the <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">base-blog-project</a>. After removing some boilerplate I was ready to write my first article.</p>
<h4 id="4.-adjusting-build-settings-in-netlify">4. Adjusting build settings in netlify <a class="direct-link" href="#4.-adjusting-build-settings-in-netlify">#</a></h4>
<p>11ty generates static HTML-files out of all markdown files. All you have to do is running the command <code>eleventy</code> in the commandline. It will generate all files into the directory <code>/_site</code>. The last step I had to configurate was to tell netlify to execute that command and point it to the target directory.</p>

<h4 id="what's-next%3F">What's next? <a class="direct-link" href="#what's-next%3F">#</a></h4>
<p>Now I can start to apply own styling, adjust strucutre of the website, add favicon, ... and of course start with other side projects I have on my mind üë®‚Äçüíª.</p>
