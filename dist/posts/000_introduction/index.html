      <h1>But why?</h1>

<p>During my years as a developer I always admired people who are active in the dev-community, who have done great work in building own things and showcasing them. Though, the correct question would be &quot;Why am I doing this NOW?&quot;.</p>
<p>I always hesitated to put side projects on the web. Most of the time I was not really satisfied with the outcome. Many ideas became too complex and started to need more time than planned. So I threw them away before starting them. Sometimes small projects I started evolved into something bigger and started to drain too much time. So I threw them away before finishing them.</p>
<p>However, I never stopped observing how other developers tackled the challenge of having a full time job and also being able to work on side projects. Many peer feedbacks with coworkers and months of self-development motivated me more to build own things. Then I stumbled upon a talk from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVsV01k1xUU">Sara Vieira about &quot;build dumb shit&quot;</a>. This made me realize that side projects don't have to be perfect or useful at all. And I thought &quot;Well, how about just building things&quot;.</p>
<p>Even though the talk was very inspiring, I did not start right away. Two more things had to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>New coworkers joined. Some of them were had achieved quite a lot in the dev-community. They didn't stop to improve themselves, despite the fear of failing. I admired their dedication and as a result my own motivation grew. Especially during talks with <a href="https://twitter.com/mirjam_diala">@mirjam_diala</a> I recieved a lot of insights on how one person can achieve a lot of great things by staying motivated and believing in themself.</li>
<li>One of my peer feedbacks convinced me to finally start. During that feedback the <a href="https://twitter.com/_coolcut">coworker</a> mentioned that he is working on his own website. That website will be a place where he showcases his side projects, while also documenting his learings during the process. His goal is not to gain fame. Instead he just wants to play around with small ideas and persist those on his website.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here I am, building the foundation of my own &quot;simple/weird/dumb projects&quot; diary.<br>
<br /></p>
<h3 id="what-will-i-write-about%3F">What will I write about? <a class="direct-link" href="#what-will-i-write-about%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>This website will be kind of a diary for my dev-related activities. I will describe how I came up with an idea for a side project, how I approached things, which problems I struggled with and so on.</p>
<p>It comes in handy that this website is also one of those side project. So I will write about the progress of it, too. Can‚Äôt stress enough, that the idea to document my journey is directly stolen from my coworker Jan (<a href="https://fruechtl.me/">fruechtl.me</a>)!</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start the journey ü§†.</p>
