Here I am, talking about my first project in the __truschkin.dev__ era, which is this website itself. To make this website work, I have already done a couple of things I have never done before. Let's investigate them step by step:

#### 0. Buying a domain
A friend of mine suggested me to look out for domains on [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/). I went for it at bought the domain you are currently visiting. Finally I can call myself a domain owner üéâ.

#### 1. Creating a repo
I created a [repo on github](https://github.com/paultrue/truschkin.dev), checked it out on my machine. I added a basic `index.html` + `.gitignore` to set a base for this project.

#### 2. Hosting website
There are many solutions to host a website. I went with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), since almost every coworker mentioned at least once how much they are in love with it. This is my first time to put a website online completely by myself, which made me really curious to see how it works out with the help of netlify. 

It turns out that netlify is pretty easy to use. All I had to do is:
1. connect my github repo to create a new "site"
2. register my freshly bought domain
3. point my domain's nameservers to netlify

To achieve the last step I went back to namecheap.com and pasted every netlify nameserver in the `Custom DNS` section in my domain settings. DONE! Some magic made my domain, netlify and github talk to each other.
Now, like most of my coworkers, I am in love with netlify as well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

#### 3. Choosing a framework for this project
Finding a base for the website was a though decision. Especially because I tent to fall into a rabbithole of exploring many possible solutions. It had to be simple to setup and easy to use. Something lightweight and well backed by the community. No complex backend- and database-setup. A static site generator was the obvious choice for me.
Some years ago I played around with [hexo](https://hexo.io/) and really enjoyed it. So I did some research on how the topic of static site generator has evolved. After reading through a couple resources [this comparison](https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator) made me finally pick [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It has great documentation, helpful tutorials for beginners and offers a bunch of ready to use starter projects. I went for the [base-blog-project](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). After removing some boilerplate I was ready to write my first article.

#### 4. Adjusting build settings in netlify
11ty generates static HTML-files out of all markdown files. All you have to do is running the command `eleventy` in the commandline. It will generate all files into the directory you define in your 11ty-configs inside `eleventy.js`. I run that command with `yarn build` and generate the whole website into `/dist`. The last step I had to configurate was to tell netlify to execute that command and point it to the target directory.

#### What's next?
Now I can start to apply own styling, adjust strucutre of the website, add favicon, ... and of course start with other side projects I have on my mind üë®‚Äçüíª.
